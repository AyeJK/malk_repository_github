# Chat Summary: Discovery Slider Sorting Bugfix
*Date: 2025-06-12*  
*Time: 22:06*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Discovery Page Slider Sorting Issue**:
   - Identified that the Discovery page's category sliders use the `/api/category-feed` endpoint to fetch posts for each category.
   - Discovered that the API was paginating the list of linked post IDs from the Airtable "Categories" table **before** sorting, causing the sliders to show posts in the order of the IDs, not by the most recent `DisplayDate`.
   - Confirmed that the Airtable API call included a sort by `DisplayDate`, but this only applied to the subset of posts fetched per page, not the entire category.

2. **Root Cause & Correct Logic**:
   - The correct approach is to fetch all posts for the category, sort them by `DisplayDate` (descending), and then paginate the sorted array.
   - This ensures the sliders always show the true most recent posts, regardless of the order of IDs in Airtable.

3. **API Patch Implementation**:
   - Refactored `/api/category-feed` to:
     - Fetch all post records for the category in one go.
     - Sort all posts by `DisplayDate` (fallback to `DateCreated` if missing).
     - Paginate the sorted array in code, not by slicing IDs first.
   - Now, the Discovery page sliders display posts in the correct order, matching the latest content in each category.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor for any performance issues with large categories (consider server-side pagination if needed).
- [ ] Apply similar logic to any other endpoints that paginate by ID before sorting (e.g., tag feeds, following feeds).
- [ ] Test the Discovery page with various categories to confirm correct ordering and UX.
