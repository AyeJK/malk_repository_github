# Chat Summary: Share Post Modal
*Date: 2025-06-05*  
*Time: 17:01:24*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Share Button Integration**:
   - Added a right-aligned Share button to the engagement row below each video in both feed and post detail views.
   - Used Heroicons for the initial icon, with a placeholder handler.

2. **Share Modal Design & Implementation**:
   - Planned and implemented a clean, minimal Share modal, styled after the existing Share Video Modal (no close button, closes on outside click).
   - Modal includes a miniature post preview with a large thumbnail, user avatar, author name, video title, and post caption.
   - Caption is always on its own line for clarity.

3. **Social Share Options**:
   - Added share buttons for Facebook, Reddit, WhatsApp, and replaced Twitter/X with Bluesky (using a custom butterfly icon and correct share intent URL).
   - Used a custom Reddit PNG icon as a React component for brand accuracy.

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Improved the post preview layout to match provided design references, including spacing, font styles, and stacking order.
   - Increased thumbnail size for better visual prominence.
   - Ensured all icons are crisp and accessible.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- Further polish or animation for modal transitions if desired.
- Optionally add more social platforms or sharing methods.
- Consider analytics for share actions.
- User feedback on modal usability and design tweaks.
