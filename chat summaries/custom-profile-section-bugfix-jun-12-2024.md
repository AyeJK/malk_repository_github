# Chat Summary: Custom Profile Section Bugfix & Pagination
*Date: 2024-06-12*  
*Time: [Insert current time here]*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Custom Category Section Not Loading Posts**:
   - Discovered that the frontend was not passing the correct `slug` to `/api/get-posts-by-category`.
   - Debugged the data flow and confirmed the canonical categories list from `/api/get-categories` included the correct slug.
   - Patched the section creation logic to always use the canonical category object (with slug) when saving custom sections.
   - Ensured the backend `/api/get-categories` always returns the Airtable "Slug" field, with fallback.

2. **Slug Missing in Saved Custom Sections**:
   - Found duplicate or stale `handleAddSection` logic in both `CustomProfileSection.tsx` and `ProfileClient.tsx`.
   - Patched both to always include the slug from the canonical categories list.
   - Fixed types and state to guarantee slug presence.

3. **Duplicate Posts in Category Custom Sections**:
   - Diagnosed that posts were being blindly appended on infinite scroll, causing duplicates.
   - Patched the frontend to use `uniqBy` when updating posts, deduplicating by post ID.
   - Enforced a 10-post-per-page limit in the UI for each category section.

4. **Backend Consistency for Tag & Category Feeds**:
   - Ensured both `/api/get-posts-by-tag` and `/api/get-posts-by-category` filter by user, sort by most recent, and paginate after filtering.
   - Confirmed both endpoints return consistent, robust results for infinite scroll.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- Monitor for any edge cases with infinite scroll or custom section persistence.
- Consider DRYing up the infinite scroll and deduplication logic for all feeds.
- Add loading skeletons and improved error handling for extra polish.
- Review and clean up any legacy or duplicate section logic/components.
