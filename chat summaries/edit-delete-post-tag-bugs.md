# Chat Summary: Edit/Delete Post Tag Bugs
*Date: 2024-05-29*  
*Time: [Current Time]*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Edit/Delete Post Auth Integration**:
   - Refactored the `/api/posts/[id]` PATCH and DELETE handlers to support Firebase Auth by verifying the ID token and mapping to the Airtable user record ID for post ownership checks.
   - Ensured no major refactor to the global auth setup was needed.

2. **Tag Handling Bugs in Edit Modal**:
   - Identified that the `UserTags` field in Airtable expects an array of record IDs, not tag names.
   - Discovered that the EditPostModal sometimes sent tag names (e.g., 'weird') instead of record IDs, causing Airtable `INVALID_RECORD_ID` errors.
   - Patched the EditPostModal to:
     - Always resolve tags to Airtable record IDs before saving.
     - Use `/api/search-tags` to look up existing tags by name.
     - Create new tags via `/api/get-tags` POST if not found.
     - Only send record IDs in the PATCH request.

3. **Backend Tag Creation Fixes**:
   - Fixed the `/api/get-tags` POST handler to only set the `Name` field (not `Slug`, which is computed in Airtable), resolving `INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN` errors.

4. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging to the PATCH handler to output the incoming body, computed updateFields, and UserTags for easier debugging.
   - Used logs to confirm that invalid tag names were being sent, pinpointing the frontend mapping issue.

5. **UI/UX Review**:
   - Confirmed that the tag dropdown in the EditPostModal is populated with `{ id, name }` objects, but hitting Enter or certain flows could still add a tag name as the ID.
   - Patched the tag addition logic to guarantee only record IDs are used.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- [ ] Test thoroughly to ensure all tag addition flows (dropdown select, Enter key, new/existing tags) always result in record IDs being sent.
- [ ] Consider adding a defensive backend filter to ignore any non-record IDs in `UserTags` for extra safety.
- [ ] Review other modals/components for similar issues with linked record fields.
- [ ] Refactor or DRY up tag handling logic if similar code exists in multiple places.

**Example Error Fixed:**
```js
Error editing post: AirtableError {
  error: 'INVALID_RECORD_ID',
  message: 'Value "weird" is not a valid record ID.',
  statusCode: 422
}
```

**Code Example (Frontend Tag Resolution):**
```typescript
for (const tag of tags) {
  if (tag.id.startsWith('rec')) {
    tagIds.push(tag.id);
  } else {
    // Look up or create tag, then push record ID
  }
}
```
