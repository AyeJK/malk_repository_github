# Chat Summary: Horizontal Slider Pagination Refactor & Loader UX Improvements

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Offset-Based Pagination for All Horizontal Sliders**:
   - Audited all API endpoints and confirmed support for `limit`/`offset` pagination.
   - Refactored Profile "Recent Posts", Discovery page sliders, and custom profile sections to use offset-based pagination and infinite scroll.
   - Ensured each slider tracks `posts`, `offset`, `hasMore`, and `isLoading` in state.
   - Implemented `onLoadMore` handlers to fetch and append additional posts as users scroll.
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     <PostSlider
       posts={recentPosts}
       isLoading={recentIsLoading && recentPosts.length === 0}
       hasMore={recentHasMore}
       onLoadMore={handleLoadMoreRecent}
     />
     ```

2. **Loader UX Consistency Across All Sliders**:
   - Refactored loader logic so skeleton cards only show on initial load (when `isLoading` is true and no posts yet).
   - For infinite scroll, only a spinner is shown at the end of the slider.
   - Applied this pattern to Profile, Discovery, and custom profile section sliders.
   - Fixed a React batching issue in custom sections by setting all section states to `isLoading: true` before fetching, ensuring skeletons render for a frame before posts arrive.
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     // In useEffect for custom sections:
     setCategorySectionState({ ...allSections, isLoading: true });
     // Then fetch and update each section individually
     ```

3. **Bugfixes & Edge Case Handling**:
   - Fixed issues where some sliders would only ever load 10 posts (no infinite scroll).
   - Ensured all sliders use the same loader and pagination logic for a unified, modern UX.
   - Addressed loader not showing on first load for custom sections by splitting state update and fetch.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor for any edge cases with large or empty feeds, or rapid section changes.
- [ ] Optionally DRY up infinite scroll logic into a shared hook if more slider variants are added.
- [ ] Further polish loader animations or add accessibility improvements if desired.
- [ ] Document the new loader and pagination patterns for future contributors.
