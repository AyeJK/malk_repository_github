# Chat Summary: Profile Likes User Info Bugfix
*Date: 2025-06-12*  
*Time: 11:48*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Diagnosing the Likes Tab User Info Bug**:
   - Identified that the Likes tab grid view was always showing 'Anonymous' and the default avatar, while the list view showed correct user info.
   - Inspected the API response and server logs, confirming that `UserName` and `UserAvatar` were always set to fallback values in the API output.
   - Determined that the API was attempting to look up users by Firebase UID, but the Posts table stores Airtable record IDs in the `FirebaseUID` field.

2. **Implementing the Real Fix**:
   - Updated `/api/get-user-liked-posts` to fetch user info by Airtable record ID (from the `FirebaseUID` field), not by Firebase UID.
   - Used the Airtable SDK's `base('Users').find(userRecordId)` to fetch the correct user record for each liked post.
   - Ensured the API attaches the correct `UserName` and `UserAvatar` fields to each post, using the resolved user data.
   - Added debug logging to verify the correct user info is being attached in the API response.

3. **Validation and Testing**:
   - Confirmed via server logs and UI that the Likes grid now displays the correct user name and avatar for each liked post.
   - Ensured the fix does not affect the list (feed) view, which already worked as expected.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- Remove or reduce debug logging in production for cleaner logs.
- Monitor for any edge cases with missing or malformed user records.
- Consider refactoring similar user lookups elsewhere in the codebase for consistency.
- Test with a variety of users and liked posts to ensure robustness.
