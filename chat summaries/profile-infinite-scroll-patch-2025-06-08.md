# Chat Summary: Profile Infinite Scroll Patch
*Date: 2025-06-08*  
*Time: 17:51*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Upgrading Profile Posts & Likes Tabs to Infinite Scroll**:
   - Refactored the user profile's Posts and Likes tabs to use infinite scroll with backend pagination.
   - Implemented Intersection Observer logic to fetch more posts/likes as the user scrolls, matching the UX of other feeds.
   - Added loading indicators and bottom-of-list loaders for a smooth experience.

2. **Backend API Enhancements**:
   - Updated `/api/get-user-posts` and `/api/get-user-liked-posts` to accept `limit`, `offset`, and `sort` query parameters.
   - Both endpoints now support sorting by `latest`, `oldest`, and `popular` (by LikeCount), and return `{ posts, nextOffset }` for pagination.
   - Ensured all sorting is handled server-side for consistency and performance.

3. **Sort Filter Compatibility**:
   - The sort filter (latest, oldest, popular) now works seamlessly with infinite scroll.
   - Changing the sort resets the feed and fetches from the top, preserving expected behavior.

4. **Frontend Refactor Details**:
   - Removed all client-side sorting logic; posts and likes are rendered in the order provided by the backend.
   - Added state for pagination, loading, and fetching-more for both tabs.
   - Ensured the UI remains responsive and error states are handled gracefully.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- Test the profile's Posts and Likes tabs with all sort options to confirm correct order and smooth infinite loading.
- Monitor for any edge cases (e.g., empty feeds, rapid sort changes, or API errors).
- Consider DRYing up the infinite scroll logic into a shared hook if further feeds are refactored.
- Watch for any performance issues with large like/post lists and optimize as needed...
