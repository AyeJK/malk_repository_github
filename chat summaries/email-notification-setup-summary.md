# Chat Summary: Email Notification Setup and Troubleshooting
*Date: 2024-05-29*  
*Time: [Please fill in current time]*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Email Notification System Design**:
   - Outlined a plan for implementing email notifications for New Like, New Comment, New Follow, New Feature, and New Post by Followed User.
   - Decided to use Resend for email delivery and Airtable as the backend for user and notification data.
   - Noted that user preferences for daily/weekly notifications are stored in Airtable.

2. **Email Template Implementation**:
   - Created React-based email templates for each notification type and a batch digest template.
   - Ensured templates support dynamic data for personalized content.

3. **Notification Script Development**:
   - Developed `scripts/send-email-notifications.ts` to:
     - Fetch users with email notifications enabled.
     - Retrieve their notifications from Airtable.
     - Gather related user/post data as needed.
     - Use the correct template and send via Resend.
     - Mark notifications as "Email Sent" to avoid duplicates.

4. **Environment Variable Troubleshooting**:
   - Identified that the script was not picking up environment variables from `.env.local`.
   - Explained Node.js only loads `.env` by default for scripts.
   - Instructed to copy contents of `.env.local` to `.env` in `malk-nextjs`.
   - Clarified that `DATABASE_URL` can be deleted if not using Prisma/local DB.

5. **Testing and Best Practices**:
   - Guided Jeremy to rerun the notification script after updating `.env`.
   - Provided best practices for environment variable management and script testing.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- [ ] Test the notification script end-to-end and confirm emails are sent as expected.
- [ ] Monitor for any further issues with environment variable loading or Airtable/Resend integration.
- [ ] Consider adding logging and error handling for production use.
- [ ] Document the notification system for future contributors.
