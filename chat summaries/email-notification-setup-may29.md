# Chat Summary: Email Notification Setup and Implementation (May 29)
*Date: 2024-05-29*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Wiring Up Email Notifications**:
   - Integrated `sendNotificationEmail` into API routes for comments, likes, and follows.
   - Ensured emails are sent after notification creation and marked as 'Email Sent' in Airtable.
   - Example code for sending and marking as sent:
     ```ts
     await sendNotificationEmail(
       { type: 'New Comment', data: { ... } },
       {
         email: Array.isArray(postOwnerRecord.fields.Email) ? postOwnerRecord.fields.Email[0] : String(postOwnerRecord.fields.Email),
         DisplayName: Array.isArray(postOwnerRecord.fields.DisplayName) ? postOwnerRecord.fields.DisplayName[0] : String(postOwnerRecord.fields.DisplayName)
       }
     );
     await base('Notifications').update([
       { id: notification.id, fields: { 'Email Sent': true } }
     ]);
     ```

2. **Linter Error Troubleshooting**:
   - Resolved type errors by coercing Airtable fields to strings before passing to the email sender.
   - Used array checks and `String()` conversion for robust type handling.

3. **Testing Guidance**:
   - Provided a step-by-step plan for testing each notification type (comment, like, follow).
   - Advised on checking both email inboxes and Airtable for 'Email Sent' flags.
   - Suggested using test email services and monitoring logs for troubleshooting.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- [ ] Test all notification flows end-to-end in the app.
- [ ] Monitor for any missed notifications or email delivery issues.
- [ ] Expand email notifications to other types (e.g., batch digest) if needed.
- [ ] Add more robust error handling and logging for production.
