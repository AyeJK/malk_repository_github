*Date: 2024-06-07*  
*Time: [Please fill in current time]*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Comment Container & Avatar Improvements**:
   - Removed the light background and horizontal padding from each comment for a cleaner, edge-to-edge look.
   - Updated all comment text and metadata to use light colors for contrast on a dark background.
   - Made usernames clickable links to user profiles, styled in the signature salmon color.
   - Ensured user avatars are displayed for each comment, falling back to initials if no image is present.
   - Aligned avatars to the top of the comment container, regardless of comment length.

2. **Comment Layout & Metadata**:
   - Placed the comment text on a new line below the "username commented:" label.
   - Moved the timestamp to a new line below the comment text, left-aligned and styled subtly.
   - Reduced bottom padding for a more compact comment list.

3. **Comment Input Box Enhancements**:
   - Removed the black background from behind thumbnails and metadata in the grid view.
   - Changed the comment input background to dark grey with light text for contrast.
   - Added the logged-in user's avatar to the left of the comment input box, matching the style of comment avatars.
   - Moved the "Post" button inside the input field, bottom-right, and only visible when typing.
   - Changed the "Post" button color to salmon with a deeper hover effect, and improved its vertical positioning.
   - Added a character limit (445) to the comment input, with a live character counter below the field.

4. **Backend/API Updates**:
   - Updated the comments API to include the commenter's profile image in the response.
   - Fixed a TypeScript error by ensuring `.filter(Boolean)` is called on an array, not a Set.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- [ ] Further fine-tune spacing or styles as needed based on user feedback.
- [ ] Consider adding error handling for image loading failures in avatars.
- [ ] Optionally, add validation or feedback for users approaching the character limit.
