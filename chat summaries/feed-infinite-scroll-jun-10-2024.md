# Chat Summary: Infinite Scroll Feed Implementation & Debugging
*Date: 2024-06-10*  
*Time: [Insert current time here]*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Infinite Scroll for Main Feed**:
   - Implemented paginated backend using Airtable REST API for `/api/get-posts`.
   - Refactored `PostsClient.tsx` to use infinite scroll with Intersection Observer and paginated API.
   - Ensured smooth loading of additional posts as the user scrolls.

2. **Extending Infinite Scroll to Following Feed**:
   - Identified all app pages/components with post feeds.
   - Focused on the following feed: refactored `/api/following-feed` to support `limit` and `offset` (cursor-based pagination).
   - Updated `FollowingClient.tsx` to use the new paginated API and infinite scroll pattern.

3. **Debugging Follow Filter Logic**:
   - Discovered that filtering by Airtable record ID did not match posts by FirebaseUID.
   - Fixed backend to map followed Airtable user IDs to FirebaseUIDs and build a correct filter formula for the REST API.
   - Verified that only posts from followed users are shown, and infinite scroll works as intended.

4. **Category Feed Infinite Scroll**:
   - Refactored `/api/get-posts-by-category` to support `limit` and `offset` (cursor-based pagination) using the Airtable REST API.
   - Updated `CategoryClient.tsx` to use the new paginated API and infinite scroll pattern.
   - Category pages now load more posts as the user scrolls, matching the UX of the main feed.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- Refactor tag feed backend and frontend for infinite scroll (next up).
- Extend infinite scroll to other feeds (e.g., Discover, Profile) for a consistent UX.
- Consider adding loading skeletons and improved error handling for extra polish.
- Monitor for any edge cases with large follow lists or empty feeds.
- Refactor and DRY up repeated infinite scroll logic if needed.
