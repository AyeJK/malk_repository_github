# Chat Summary: Tag Feed Infinite Scroll & Bugfix
*Date: 2024-06-11*  
*Time: [Insert current time here]*

In this session, we addressed:

1. **Refactoring Tag Feed for Infinite Scroll**:
   - Updated `/api/get-posts-by-tag` API to support `limit` and `offset` for paginated fetching using the Airtable REST API.
   - Refactored `TagClient.tsx` to use infinite scroll with Intersection Observer, matching the main feed UX.
   - Posts are now loaded in pages and appended as the user scrolls.

2. **Bug: Tag Feed Shows 'No Posts' Despite Post Count**:
   - Discovered that the tag header showed the correct post count, but the feed was empty.
   - Diagnosed the issue as a filter formula mismatch: the API was not fetching posts by their record IDs, leading to empty results.
   - Fixed the API to paginate the tag's `Posts` field manually and fetch posts by their record IDs using `OR(RECORD_ID()='id1', ...)`.
   - Now, the tag feed always matches the tag's post count and displays the correct posts.

   ```typescript
   // Example: Fetching posts by record IDs
   const paginatedPostIds = postIds.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
   const url = `.../Posts?filterByFormula=OR(${paginatedPostIds.map(id => `RECORD_ID()='${id}'`).join(',')})`;
   ```

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

- Monitor for any edge cases with tag feeds (e.g., tags with a large number of posts).
- Consider DRYing up infinite scroll logic across all feeds with a custom hook.
- Extend this robust pagination pattern to other filtered feeds (e.g., user, discover, profile) for consistency.
- Add loading skeletons and improved error handling for extra polish.
