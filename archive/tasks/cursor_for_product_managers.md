# Using Cursor AI for Product Management: A Guide to Creating Project Plans

As a Product Manager, you're likely familiar with Cursor as a powerful AI-powered code editor. But did you know it can be an invaluable tool for product management tasks as well? In this post, I'll show you how I used Cursor to create a comprehensive project plan and import it into Airtable as a project tracker.

## Why Cursor for Product Management?

While Cursor is primarily known for its coding capabilities, its AI assistant can help with various product management tasks:

- Breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks
- Creating structured project plans
- Generating documentation in multiple formats
- Maintaining consistency in task descriptions and dependencies

## The Process: From Plan to Project Tracker

### 1. Starting with a Migration Plan

I began with a high-level migration plan document that outlined the phases and major components of our project. The plan was written in markdown format, which Cursor handles beautifully.

```markdown
# Malk.tv Migration Plan

## Phase 1: Setup
1. Development Environment
2. Core Infrastructure

## Phase 2: Core Development
1. Authentication System
2. Data Layer
3. API Endpoints
```

### 2. Converting to Structured Tasks

Using Cursor's AI assistant, I converted the high-level plan into detailed tasks. The assistant helped me:
- Break down each phase into specific, actionable tasks
- Add estimated durations
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Create consistent task descriptions

### 3. Creating a CSV for Airtable

The AI assistant helped me structure the tasks into a CSV format that Airtable could easily import. The key was to:
- Make Task Name the primary column
- Include all necessary metadata (Phase, Description, Duration, etc.)
- Format dependencies clearly
- Use proper CSV formatting with quotes for fields containing commas

```csv
Task Name,Phase,Description,Estimated Duration,Dependencies,Status
"Set up new repository","Phase 1","Initialize new repository and configure version control","1 day","","Not Started"
```

### 4. Importing into Airtable

Once the CSV was ready, importing into Airtable was straightforward:
1. Create a new base in Airtable
2. Create a table with matching column names
3. Use Airtable's import function to upload the CSV
4. Map the columns to your preferred view

## Benefits of Using Cursor for This Process

1. **Consistency**: The AI assistant helps maintain consistent formatting and terminology across all tasks.

2. **Efficiency**: Instead of manually creating each task, the AI can generate a complete project structure in seconds.

3. **Flexibility**: Need the plan in a different format? The AI can quickly convert it to JSON, markdown, or other formats.

4. **Iteration**: Want to add more detail or modify the structure? The AI can help restructure the entire plan while maintaining all relationships and dependencies.

## Tips for Product Managers

1. **Start with Clear Structure**: Begin with a well-organized markdown document that outlines your project phases and major components.

2. **Be Specific**: When asking the AI to break down tasks, be specific about what information you need (durations, dependencies, etc.).

3. **Review and Refine**: While the AI can create a comprehensive plan, always review and refine the output to ensure it matches your team's needs.

4. **Use Version Control**: Since you're working in Cursor, you can use git to track changes to your project plan, just like you would with code.

## Example Commands

Here are some example prompts you can use with Cursor's AI assistant:

```
"Break down Phase 1 into specific tasks with estimated durations"
"Add dependencies between these tasks"
"Convert this project plan into a CSV format for Airtable"
"Add more detail to the task descriptions"
```

## Conclusion

While Cursor is primarily a code editor, its AI capabilities make it a powerful tool for product management tasks. By leveraging the AI assistant, you can quickly create comprehensive project plans and convert them into formats that work with your preferred project management tools.

The next time you need to create a project plan, consider using Cursor instead of manually creating tasks in your project management software. You might be surprised at how much time and effort it can save.
